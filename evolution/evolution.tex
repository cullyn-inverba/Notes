\section{Evolutionary Thinking}\phantomsection
\subsection{Introduction (Lecture)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Essential questions of evolutionary biology: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Why do organisms look so different?
            \item Why develop elaborate sexual traits?
            \item Why do organisms senesce?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Evolution is mainly an historical science and thus must relay on other methods of reconstructing the past or making inferences about evolutionary forces. 
    \item \textbf{Proximate}: a question about a mechanistic cause; provides an immediate explanation about {\color{o-Sun}how} a mechanistic cause functions.
    \item \textbf{Ultimate}: {\color{o-Sun}why}, or the reason, a trait or organism is the way it is; an evolutionary explanation.
    \item Example of proximate vs ultimate in Galapagos finches: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Proxmate: developmental growth factor is increased/decreased in some birds.
            \item Ultimate: different habits are selected on breaks that maxmize food gathering ability.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Evolutionary biology's approach to answering questions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Empirical data}: {\color{o-Sun}observation} studies, experiments; the \textit{comparative method}.
            \item \textbf{Theory}: {\color{o-Sun}predictions} that use models and mathematical reasoning which can be be {\color{o-Sun}tested} with empirical data.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Overview of the components of evolution by natural selection:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Genetic variation exists, via mutations.
            \item Mutations are heritable.
            \item The is an advantage to survival and/or reproduction from the mutation.
            \item Individuals with the advantage in survival/reproduction are selected for.
        \end{itemize}

\section{Studying Adaptation}\phantomsection
\subsection{Hypothesis Testing: Oxpeckers Reconsidered}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adaption}: a trait, or a suite of traits, that increases the fitness of its possessor.
    \item No hypothesis for the adaptive value of a trait should be accepted simply because of its plausibility.
    \item Oxpeckers and impalas traditionally were thought to have a mutally beneficial existence; oxpeckers ate ticks and impalas provided a safe environment.
    \item Experiments on cattle were done to test whether this observation was true:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Results show red-billed oxpeckers have no effect tick loads of cattle.
            \item Red-billeld oxpeckers maintained open wounds, even enlarging existing wounds to feed on the cattle's blood.
            \item Red-billed oxpeckers removed hosts' earwax; whether this is good of bad is unclear.
            \item Even these results must remain in question, as cattle are not the native host for the birds.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Other important points to remember: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Differences among populations or species are not always adaptive.
            \item Not every trait is adaptive.
            \item Not every adaptation is perfect, often the adaption just happened to work well enough or by chance better than other adaptations.
        \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Defining and testing effective control groups is critical.
    \item Treatments of controls and experimental measures must be handled as close to exactly alike as possible.
    \item Randomization is a key technique for equalizing miscellaneous effects and a tool to avoid bias.
    \item Reproduction is essential in order to help remove potential outlier effects.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Allows for greater understanding of precision, accuracy, and variation by providing more data for statistical tests.
        \end{itemize}

\section{Evolutionary Trees}\phantomsection
\subsection{How to Read an Evolutionary Tree}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phylogeny}: aka evolutionary tree or phylogenetic tree, is a diaggram showing the history of divergence and evolutionary change. Essentially, it's the {\color{o-Sun}genealogical relationships} of organisms based on descent with modification.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Taxa}: the units you are analyzing, e.g. certain species or DNA sequences.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Character}: a feature or trait present among the taxa of interest, e.g. teeth of mammals or nucleotides of DNA sequences.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textit{Character {\color{o-Sun}state(s)}}: an {\color{o-Sun}alternative condition} of a character, which are able to evolve one to another, e.g. pointed/flat teeth of mammals.
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item \textit{{\color{true}Ancestral} character}: a trait that was {\color{true}possessed by the common ancestor}.
                    \item \textit{{\color{false}Derived} character}: a trait the was {\color{false}not possessed by the common ancestor} and instead {\color{o-Sun}evolved} in at least one of the descendants.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{Synapomorphy}: derived character state shared by {\color{o-Sun} two or more} taxa and used to define a clade of taxa.
                            \item \textbf{Autapomorphy}: derived character state in only {\color{o-Sun}one} taxon.
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Outgroup}: a taxon or taxa that are used to root the phylogeny or determine ancestral character states.
                    \item \textbf{Ingroup}: the set of taxa that are the focus of the phylogeny.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Nodes}: points at which the tree splits; represents mutations, speciation events, or {\color{o-Sun}character changes}.
        \item {\color{false}\textbf{Anagensis}}: descent with modification, but {\color{false}no speciation}.
        \item {\color{true}\textbf{Cladogenesis}}: {\color{true}speciation}, origin of clades.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Clade}: also known as a {\color{o-Sun}monophyletic group}, an ancestor and {\color{o-Sun}all} of its descendants.
            \item \textbf{Paraphyletic group}: a group of organisms consisting of an ancestor and {\color{o-Sun}some} of its descendants.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Sister}: a taxa or clade that are most closely related to each other; they {\color{o-Sun}share the most recent} common ancestor. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homology}: similarity due to common descent; {\color{true}continuity} of a trait, character, or character state through time.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Homologous trait}: found in a taxa that inherited the trait from a common ancestor.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homoplasy}: or analogous, similarity in the characters or traits in different taxa due to convergent evolution, parallelism, or reversal, but {\color{false}not due to common descent}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Convergent evolution}: similar traits due to selective forces and {\color{false}not shared ancestry}.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Parallelism}: convergent evolution in {\color{o-Sun}recently diverged} taxa.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reversal}: derived traits or character states that revert to the ancestral form.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inferring Phylogenetic Trees}
\begin{itemize}    
    \item \textbf{Parsimony}: relationships that require the {\color{o-Sun}smallest number of character changes} are most likely to be correct.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Based on shared and {\color{false}derived} traits(synapomorphies).
            \item Reconstruction using parsimony:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item[1.] Code characters.
                    \item[2.] Make up a taxon$\times$character matrix.
                    \item[3.] Search for synapomorphies, and the shortest tree.
                    \item Outgroups can help polarize (ancestral vs derived) the characters. 
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Treelength}: a measure of evolutionary change using parsimony. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Shortest tree length produces most parsimonious tree.
                    \item Length determined by number of synapomorphies.
                    \item Homoplasious characters increase tree length.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distance Methods}: converts a sequence alignment to genetic distances between pairs of sequences.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Branch length is proportional to genetic differences.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maximum likelihood}: a method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by {\color{o-Sun}maximizing a \textit{likelihood function}}. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item One of the more dominant means of statistical inference.
            \item \textbf{Likelihood}: measure of goodness of fit of a statistical model to a sample of data for given values of the unknown parameters.
            \item {\color{o-Sun}\(P(D|H)\)}; probability(P), Data(D), Hypothesis(H)
            \item \textbf{Bayesian}: uses the likelihood function to create a quantity called the \textit{posterior probability} of trees using a model of evolution based on prior probabilities in order to produce the most likely tree.
            \item \textbf{Bootstraping}: creating a value that indicates how many times out of 100 (normally) that the same branch was observed when repeating the phylogenetic reconstruction on re-sampled (pseudoreplicated) set of dat.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Molecular clocks}: the average rate at which species' genomes accumulates mutations over time.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Generally a linear rate.
            \item Used to measure evolutionary divergence.
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population}: a group of interbreeding individuals and their offsring.
    \item \textbf{Gene pool}: the set of all genes, or genetic information, in any population.
    \item \textbf{Genotypic frequency}: number of individuals with a given genotype divided by the total number of individuals in the population.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The proportion (i.e., \(0<f<1\)) of genotypes in a population.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Allele frequencies}: relative frequency of an allele at a particular locus in a population.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Locus}: a fixed position on a chromosome where a particular gene of genetic marker is.
            \item Monoploids: frequency of an allele is the result of the number of copies of the allele divided by sample size.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \(p=i/N\)
                    \item \(p\): frequency |  \(i\): copies of alleles |  \(N\): sample size
                \end{itemize}
            \item Diploids: frequency of alleles within three possbile genotypes at a locus with two alleles.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \({\color{o-Sun}p}=f({\color{o-Sun}AA})+\frac{1}{2}f(AB)\)~~frequency of {\color{o-Sun}A}-allele 
                    \item \({\color{o-Sun}q}=f({\color{o-Sun}BB})+\frac{1}{2}f(AB)\)~~frequency of {\color{o-Sun}B}-allele
                \end{itemize}
            \item Allele frequency can always be calculated from genotype frequency, whereas the reverse requires the \textit{Hardy-Weinberg principle} of random mating apply.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hardy-Weinberg principle}: allele and genotype {\color{o-Sun}frequencies} in a population will remain {\color{o-Sun}constant} in the {\color{o-Sun}absence of evolutionary influences}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Allele frequencies do not change from one generation to the next.
            \item Genotypic frequencies after one generation of random mating: \(p^2 + 2pq + q^2\)
            \item Evolutionary influences: genetic drift, mate choice, assortative mating, natural selection, sexual selection, mutation, gene flow, meiotic drive, genetic hitchhicking, population bottleneck, founder effect, and inbreeding.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Most of these influences will be discussed later}.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Selection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fitness}: success at which a organism produces fertile offspring.
    \item \textbf{Competition}: an interaction between organism in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another.
    \item \textbf{Selection}: the act on a heritable phenotypic trait due to competition.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can be members of the same of different species.
        \item Not always directional and adaptive, instead selection pressure is applied and removes the less fit variants.
        \item Can be classified in different ways, such as effect on a trait, on genetic diversity, by life cycle, by unit of selection, or by the resource in competition.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{By Effect on a Trait}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Stablizing selection}: the simplies case in which selection acts to hold a trait at a stable optimum.
        \item \textbf{Directional selection}: favours extreme values of a trait.
        \item \textbf{Disruptive selection}: acts during transition periods when current mode is sub-optimal, but alters trait in more than one direction.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Univariate}: when the trait is both quantitatively favoured in either direction and can lead to speciation.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{By Effect on Genetic Diversity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purifying selection}: aka negative selection; acts to remove genetic variation from the population.
        \item \textbf{\textit{de novo} mutation}: introduces new variation and opposes negative selection.
        \item \textbf{Balancing selection}: acts to maintain genetic variation, even in absence of \textit{de novo} mutation by frequency-dependent selection.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Frequency-dependent selection}: fitness depends of the phenotypic or genotypic composition of a population. 
                \item \textbf{Heterozygote advantage}: when a combination of alleles confers a selective advantage over individuals with one allele; one mechanism of balacing selection.
            \end{itemize}
