\section{NMR Basics}\label{NMR Basics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \ddd{NMR spectroscopy}: a technique to observe local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei using excitation of nuclei with radio waves.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Radio waves triggers nuclear magnetic resonance, which changes resonance frequency, giving access to detail of the electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional groups.
      \end{itemize}
    \item NMR usually involves three sequential steps:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Alignment (polarization) of magnetic nuclear spins in an applied, constant magnetic field \(B_0\).
        \item Perturbations of the nuclear spins by weak oscillating magnetic fields, usually referred to as a radio-frequency (RF) pulse.
        \item Detection and analysis of electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the sample as a result of the perturbation.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Organic chemist are usually limited to proton (\(^1_1H\)) and carbon-13 (\(^{13}_6C\)), but can be used on more.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proton NMR Spectroscopy}\label{Proton NMR Spectroscopy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Proton NMR}: specific application of NMR spectroscopy with respect to hydrogen-1 nuclei within the molecule of a substance in order to determine structure.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item There are four main characteristics analyzed in order to determine the structure, signal quantity, location (shift), area (integration), and shape (spin-spin).
      \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Signal Quantity}\label{Signal Quantity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The number of signals identifies the number of different types of protons in the sample.
        \item \ddd{Chemically equivalent proton}: protons that share the same chemical environment.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \ch{CH3}, \ch{CH2}, and \ch{CH} will always be non-equivalent to each other.
            \item Protons are chemically equivalent if they are equivalent via symmetry considerations.
          \end{itemize}
        \item Differences in chemical environment will show up as the same peak.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item E.g., ethane has 6 hydrogens that all have the same chemical environment, while butane has two different chemically equivalent groups \(2\times \)(\ch{CH3,~CH2})
          \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Signal Location}\label{Chemical Shifts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Chemical shift} \(\delta \): the resonant frequency of a nucleus relative to a standard in a magnetic field, i.e., \emph{where} the signal shows up on the \emph{x-axis} of the NMR spectrum.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \(\delta = \dfrac{\nu_{sample}-\nu_{ref}}{\nu_{ref}}\)
            \item \(\nu_{sample}\): absolute resonance frequency of the sample.
            \item \(\nu_{ref} \): absolute resonance frequency of a standard reference compound in the same applied magnetic field \(B_0\).
            \item \(\delta \) expressed in parts per million.
          \end{itemize}
        \item Chemical shift can have deviations; exact value depends on molecular structure of solvent, temperature, magnetic field, and neighboring functional groups.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Tells us about the chemical or electrical environment in regard to proton NMR\@.
          \end{itemize}
        \item NMR plots have an x-axis of 0--14 ppm.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Closer to 0 is the ``upfield.''
            \item Closer to 14 is the  ``downfield.''
            \item Comparisons are relative. 
          \end{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Shielding}: an opposed magnetic field (\(B_i\)) to an applied field (\(B_0\)) induced by circulating electrons from adjacent bonds and atoms. 
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \(B = B_0 - B_i\)
            \item \ddd{Shielded}: when nucleus of interest is surrounded by high electron density, making it more \emph{upfield}.
            \item \ddd{Deshielded}: the inverse of shielded; when electron density is pulled away from the nucleus, making if more \emph{downfield}. 
          \end{itemize}
        \item Increased electronegativity of nearby atoms decreases shielding (increasing deshielding), thus making the chemical shift more downfield.
        \item Inductive effect decreases with distance, decreasing degree of chemical shift.
    \end{itemize}
