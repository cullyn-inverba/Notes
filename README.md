# Portland State University Class Resources
Hello, and welcome. This repository is an attempt at increasing the effectivness of online learning, for myself and others. The main function of this repository will be a place to store and share notes I make, as well act as a means to hopefully encourage others to do the same.

### Disclaimers
* Some information could straight up be wrong&mdash;I'm learning too after all. Please don't be afraid to point out errors! It's part of the reason I'm making this public. 

* Most of old files are compressed and here just in case I need them, but once most of previously mentioned goals are complete, then most of my depreciated notes files will be gone. Only notes that I deem to be good enough will remain in the future.
