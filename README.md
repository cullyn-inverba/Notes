# Portland State University Class Resources

Fall Term has just ended. I am currently working on making these notes I take even more accessible for others in preparation for winter term. That being said, my current goals for this repository:

- [ ] Create cleaner, more stabilized versions of my custom class and style preferences.
    - [ ] Create custom classes for essays, articles, notes, and potentially others.
    - [x] Clean up .sty file.
    - [x] Establish primary dark-theme.
    - [ ] Create optional light-theme.
    - [ ] Leave sufficient comments for optional customization by others.
    - [x] Find a better integrated spell/grammar checker.
- [ ] Make the repository more accessible.
    - [ ] Create a more detailed README for the repository in general.
    - [x] Establish a more standardized note taking structure.
    - [ ] Create detailed introduction to note structure.
- [ ] Make it easier for others to contribute.
    - [ ] Create more ways to easily share and discuss class problems.
    - [ ] Create videos tutorials about LateX.
        - [ ] Learn how to make videos... simple as learning to draw an owl right?
        - [ ] Learn to use manim.
- [ ] Learn how to properly manage a repository with multiple contributors.
    - [ ] Complete all prerequisite tasks above.
    - [ ] ???

### Disclaimers

* Some information could straight up be wrong&mdash;I'm learning too after all. Please don't be afraid to point out errors! It's part of the reason I'm making this public. 

* Most of old files are compressed and here just in case I need them, but once most of previously mentioned goals are complete, then most of my depreciated notes files will be gone. Only notes that I deem to be good enough and suspect others might actually use will remain in the future.
