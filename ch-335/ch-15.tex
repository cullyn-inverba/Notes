\begin{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Contains two unhybridized p-orbitals (sp) on each carbon.

      \item Large amount of \(s\) character (\bbb{sp: 50\% \(s\)}) makes the hydrogens very acidic and the carbons very basic. 
      \item 1 mole of base takes off 1 hydrogen (1 equivalent, equiv, eq), which can be done twice to take off both (2 equivalent).  
      \item Traditionally known as acetylenes, though acetylene referers specifically to \ch{C2H2} (ethyne)
    \end{itemize}
    
  \subsection{Acetylides}\label{Acetylides}
  \item \ddd{Acetylide}: an alkyne with a negatively charged carbon on one end, e.g.,

    \item \bbb{:B} is a name of generic base, typical bases used:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \bbb{\ch{NaNH2}} \to~sodamide, or \bbb{\ch{NaH}} \to~sodium hydride.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Acetylide acts as a \emph{nucleophile} when it reacts with an epoxide, \ang{1}-halide, or a methyl-halide.

      \item Acetylide acts as a \emph{base} when it reacts with \ang{2}-halide or a \ang{3}-halide due to steric crowding.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Is an  E2 reaction.

      \item The Zaitsev product is more likely to be the major product due to the thermodynamics (more energetically stable) than the Hofmann product; a bulkier base would likely increase the Hofmann product. 

      \subsection{Regioselectivity and Stereospecificity of E2 Reactions}
        \item \ddd{Regiochemistry}: when a chemical reaction is said to produce two different regiochemical outcomes.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \ddd{Regiochemical}: preference of chemical bonding or breaking \emph{direction}. 
            \end{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Regioselective}: when there is a preference in products of a regiochemical reaction.
        \item \ddd{Zaitsev product}: name of the \emph{more substituted} alkene that is generally observed to be the major product.
        \item \ddd{Hofmann product}: name of the \emph{less substituted} alkene.
        \item There ratio between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product is dependent on a number of factors and often difficult to predict.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Steric hindrance of the base often plays a major role, often increasing the Hofmann product.
                \item The outcome of E2 reactions can often be carefully \emph{ controlled by choosing the base}, despite difficultly in overall prediction.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Stereospecific}: when the stereoisomeric product of the E2 process depends on the configuration of the starting stereoisomeric substrate.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The stereospecificity is only relevant when the \emph{\(\beta \) position has only one proton}.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Stereoselective}: when the substrate itself is not necessarily stereoisomeric, but can yield two stereoisomeric products, one of which that often has a higher yield.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Occurs when there are \emph{more than one proton in the \(\beta \) position}.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Coplanar}: when the proton in the \(\beta \) position, the leaving group, and the two carbons atoms that form a double bond lie on the same plane.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Often leads only one stereoisomer product being formed, thus more often stereospecific.
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item If it stereoselective, then usually \textit{trans} conformation is favored.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item \ddd{Periplanar}: when the proton and leaving group are \emph{nearly} coplanar; often is used in place of coplanar to incorporate both situations.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Syn-coplanar}: when the proton and the leaving group are \emph{ eclipsed} in a coplanar conformation.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Elimination in this state involves a higher energy transition state due to eclipsed geometry, and is \emph{slower} than anti-coplanar arrangement.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \ddd{Anti-coplanar}: when the proton and the leaving group are \emph{staggered} in a coplanar conformation.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Elimination in this state involves a lower energy transition state due to staggered geometry, leading to a \emph{faster} reaction relative to syn-coplanar.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
