\section*{Part I: Homeostasis}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide]
    {\color{under}\item List three behaviors and three physiological mechanisms that occur in humans to cool the body when it is overheated. \textbf{(2 pts)}}
    \begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide]
        {\color{under}\item Behaviors:} Take off clothing, seek shade or cool places, and drink or enter cold water.

        {\color{under}\item Physiological mechanisms:} Sweating, radiating heat by thermal radiation, and vasodilation which brings more blood to the surface of the skin.

    \end{enumerate}
    {\color{under}\item Using a physiological example (hormone secretion, blood pressure regulation, etc.), draw a schematic that demonstrates a negative feed-back mechanism. Use your textbook and/or the internet to help you. \textbf{(1 pt)}}
    
    
    {\color{under}\item Can set points ever be changed? (Hint: What happens to set temperature during a fever? \textbf{(1 pt)}}

    Yes, in the case of the fever your body is changing the set point intentionally in order to fight the fever as an immune reaction.

    {\color{under}\item Prostaglandin, a type of hormone, influences the temperature-control center in the hypothalamus. Interestingly, bacterial infections increase prostaglandin synthesis. \textbf{(1.5 pts)}}
    \begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide]
        {\color{under}\item What effect do you think prostaglandin has on set temperature? \textbf{(0.5 pt)}}

        Prostaglandins are locally-acting vasodilators and inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets that plays a role in vasodilation.

        {\color{under}\item Which basic component of the feedback loop (as shown in Figure 1) for body temperature control does prostaglandin affect? \textbf{(0.5 pt)}}

        Prostaglandins would be considered an effector as it is actually causing the change that produces an effect.

        {\color{under}\item What effect does acetaminophen (Tylenol, a fever-reducing or antipyretic drug) have on prostaglandin synthesis? \textbf{(0.5 pt)}}

        Acetaminophen is generally considered to be a weak inhibitor of the synthesis of prostaglandins.

    \end{enumerate}
    {\color{under}\item For each of the following feedback mechanisms, indicate whether it is an example of a negative or a positive feedback loop. Explain your reasoning. Although some of the examples are not physiological processes, the basic principles are the same. \textbf{(3 pts)}}
    \begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide]
        {\color{under}\item A snowball rolling down a hill becomes larger and larger, making it roll faster and become larger still. \textbf{(1 pt)}}

        Positive, the more it moves the larger it gets which makes it more likely to move and gain more snow and wouldn't stop unless influenced by something else.

        {\color{under}\item  You are determined to earn an A in Biology. You decide to seek help from a tutor. The tutor is helpful, but very expensive. In order to pay the tutor, you must start working nights. Working reduces your study time, and your grades fall in the course. Thus, you spend more time with the tutor, meaning you have to earn more money. As a result of working more, your grades in the course fall even more. You decide to spend even more time with the tutor. \textbf{(1 pt)}}

        Negative feedback, you grade falls depending on time, but the tutor is requiring more time not related to school work and you eventually won't have any time.

        {\color{under}\item A decrease in the set-point concentration for thyroid hormones results in a greater inhibitory signal from the thyroid gland (effector). \textbf{(1 pt)}}

        Negative, a decrease in hormones results in a reduced production of hormones which will continue until it no longer has an effect.

\section*{Part II: Resting and Active Heart Rates}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide, resume]

    Hypothesis: The more active groups will have a faster recovery time. 

    Null: There will be no significant difference between groups. 

    Alternative: The less active group will have faster recovery times.

    Rapid transport of oxygen is no longer needed; it would be a waste and would over stress the heart to continue.

\section*{Part III: Meditation and Neuroscience}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide, resume]
    {\color{under}\item Based on Box 4, explain one way that mindfulness meditation may reduce stress? \textbf{(1 pt)}}
    
    It is possible that mindfulness meditation reduces stress by improving self-regulation, which enhances neuroplasticity and leads to health benefits.

    {\color{under}\item Is there a connection between meditation and heart rate? \textbf{(1 pt)}}
    
    The paper does not mention any correlation between heart rates and meditation, but does mention heart rate variability in Zen meditators. Based on previous knowledge I have heard heart rate can be affected by rate of breath, so it's possible types of mediation might.

    {\color{under}\item Now, take your resting heart rate and record your BPM: {\color{darkmodetext} 80}
    
    As a class you will participate in Day 1 of Waking Up.  When the audio ends, take your resting heart rate (BPM) again: {\color{darkmodetext} 78}

    Was there a difference? \textbf{(1 pt)}}

    Not a significant difference.
