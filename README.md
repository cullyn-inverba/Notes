# Doesn't look like anything to me. 

Initially made this to get a basic understanding of how to use git and integrate latex into vscode. 

There is no real reason for me to continue to push my notes here, but it's usefull to come back to tex code for future projects. There's probably a better way to do so admittedly, but I'm addicted to seeing commit logs as sign of progress tracking. 

Tell my what you think of my later dark mode pdf made with latex! I'll added better commit messages too, ignore the majority of my previous ones.
