# Current Portland State University Class Resources

Fall Term has just ended. I am currently working on making these notes I take even more acessable for others in preparation for winter term. That being said, my current goals for this repository:

- [] Create cleaner, more stabalized versions of my custom class and style preferences.
    - [] Create custom classes for essays, articles, notes, and potentially others.
    - [] Clean up .sty file.
    - [] Leave sufficient comments for easier optional customization by others.
    - [x] Establish primary dark-theme.
    - [] Create optional light-theme.
- [] Make repository more accessible.
    - [] Create a more detailed README for repository in general.
    - [x] Establish a more standardized note taking structure.
    - [] Create detailed introduction to note structure.
- [] Make it easier for others to contribute.
    - [] Create videos tutorials about LateX.
        - [] Learn how to make videos\(\ldots\)
    - [] Encourage others to learn and use LateX.
- [] Learn how o properly manager a repository.
    - [] Complete all pre-requisite tasks above.
    - [] Discover problems and add them to this list.

### Disclamers
Starting September 2020 I am attempting to make my notes useable for others than myself. I will attempt give more detailed information even if I think it's not worth noting down or expalining fully. There is a developing structure to the notes, so there are continuous updates to conventions in note structure. At some point I might make a brief guide, but my attempt is to make notes self-explanatory.

There is a mediocre spell check (meant for coding, not notes) and no grammar check. I like this as if forces good typing habits, but I can easily miss typos.

Also, some information could straight up be wrong&mdash; I'm learning too after all. Organization isn't always the best either; I'm often creating notes from a mixture of live lectures, textbooks, wikipedia, and youtube videos.
