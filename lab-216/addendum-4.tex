    {\color{under}\item Name two variables that remained constant throughout the lab. \textbf{(1 pt)}}

    >> Answer

    {\color{under}\item Name the \textit{dependent} variable. \textbf{(1 pt)}}

    >> Answer

    {\color{under}\item Name the \textit{independent} variable.\textbf{(1 pt)}}

    >> Answer

    {\color{under} The percent concentration of both fluids is different. There is {\color{darkmodetext}\textbf{}\%} sugar in the beaker and {\color{darkmodetext}\textbf{}\%} sugar in the dialysis tube. Now, think of it from the water's point of  view. There is {\color{darkmodetext}\textbf{}\%} water in the beaker and {\color{darkmodetext}\textbf{}\%} in the dialysis tube}

    {\color{under}\item Answer the following:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        {\color{under}\item Did the beaker have a higher/lower concentration of water than the dialysis tube? \textbf{0.5 pt}}

        >> Answer 

        {\color{under}\item Did the water flow in or out of the tube and what type of diffusion is this? \textbf{0.5 pt}}

        >> Answer

        {\color{under}\item How will the water flow in this situation? If the tube was a cell, what type of solution was the cell placed in? \textbf{0.5 pt}}

        >> Answer 
    \end{enumerate}

    {\color{under}\item Answer the following:}
