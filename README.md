Hello and welcome. This repository is an attempt at increasing the effectiveness of online learning, for myself and others. The main function of this repository will be a place to store and share notes I make&mdash;hopefully doing so will encourage others to do the same!

### Disclaimers

- Some information could up be wrong&mdash;I'm learning too after all. Please don't be afraid to point out errors! It's part of the reason I'm making this public.

- Most of old files are compressed and here just in case I need them, but once most of previously mentioned goals are complete, then most of my depreciated notes files will be gone. Only notes that I deem to be good enough will remain in the future.
