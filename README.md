## Hello!

Initially made this to get a basic understanding of how to use git and a means for integrating latex into vscode using the fantstic latex workshop extension: https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop.

Much of my previous school work, mostly just calculus and physics, was done on overleaf and is not included in this repository. Most university classes and various online notes will be located here going forward. Much of my old work, even in vscode, is depreciated. 

### Disclamers
Starting September 2020 I am attempting to make my notes useable for others than myself. I will attempt give more detailed information even if I think it's not worth noting down or expalining fully. There is a developing structure to the notes, so there are continuous updates to conventions in note structure. At some point I might make a brief guide, but my attempt is to make notes self-explanatory.

There is a mediocre spell check (meant for coding, not notes) and no grammar check. I like this as if forces good typing habits, but I can easily miss typos.

Also, some information could straight up be wrong&mdash; I'm learning too after all. Organization isn't always the best either; I'm often creating notes from a mixture of live lectures, textbooks, wikipedia, and youtube videos.

These notes are a work in progress and I update often. They can be downladed (easier to navigate) but will mostly likely be changed one to two days later.
