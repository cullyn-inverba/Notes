\section*{Part B: Measuring Salinity in Estuaries}
\subsection*{Level 3: Measuring Salinity in Estuaries}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide, resume]
    \item Question \#5 from the activity: Which statement represents a valid conclusion based on the graph?  Enter the correct letter and the statement (0.5pts)\par

    C. A rainstorm on Oct 25 may have caused the decrease in salinity on Oct 27

    \item What may have caused Delta Smelt to be found outside of their normal range? (0.5pts)\par 

    There was a significant amount of rainfall during the times the salinity was higher than 2, and salinity also spiked when ever rainfall increased. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Level 4 - Research Question: Predicting the Return of the Atlantic Sturgeon}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide, resume]
    \item To get started, use the online Fact Sheet to select an estuary where Atlantic Sturgeon are found. Record the estuary name and location here:  (0.5pts) \par 

    The location we chose was Chesapeake Bay, MD. 

    \item Write your research question in the space below. (1pt)\par 

    How does dissolved oxygen and temperature change over 

    \item Complete the table (1pt)\par

    \item Can you identify a time period when the water temperature is within the range for the sturgeon to return? (0.5pts)
    \item What is the range of the other water quality parameters during that time period? (0.5pts)
    \item Can you identify a time period when all the conditions look right for the sturgeon to return to spawn? (0.5pts)
    \item Do the same conditions occur around the same time, year after year? (0.5pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Level 5: Work as a team to develop your own investigation}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, wide, resume]
    \item Read through Level 5 on your own, and then work with your team to develop your research question. State your research question here: (1 pt)
    \item State your hypothesis: (1 pt)
    \item \textit{Make a Plan:} Make a lis below of the specific data you will need to answer the question (1 pt) \par

    \item Other than the data listed above, what other information (if any) will you need to answer your question? (1 pt)
    \item Insert figure here (1 pt)
    \item \textit{Interpret the data:} What does your data show? Be specific and descriptive. Does the data support your hypothesis? (1 pt)
    \item \textit{Draw a Conclusion:} What is the answer to your question? Use evidence and data to support your conclusion. (1 pt)
    \item Give a specific example of why it would be biologically relevant to measure \textbf{temperature} in an aquatic environment. (1 point)
    \item Give a specific example of why it would be biologically relevant to measure \textbf{dissolved oxygen} in an aquatic environment. (1 point)
    \item Give a specific example of why it would be biologically relevant to measure \textbf{carbon dioxide} in an aquatic environment. (1 point)
