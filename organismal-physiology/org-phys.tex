\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is physiology?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Form and function of organisms; the study of how organisms work.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Central questions of physiology: {\color{o-Sun}mechanism} and {\color{o-Sun}origin}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mechanism:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Refers to the {\color{o-Sun}components} of living organisms and understanding {\color{o-Sun}how} components interact to enable the organism to function.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Origin:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Asks why a mechanism exists, or {\color{o-Sun}what} is the mechanistic {\color{o-Sun}adaptive significance} of the mechanism.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Mechanism and adaptive significance are distinct concepts; knowing about one doesn't necessarily mean you know anything about the other.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Krogh's principle: \begin{quote}\color{G-Moon}
        "For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied."\end{quote}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This idea is central to disciplines that rely on the \textit{comparative method}.
            \item Other key concepts:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item There is unity in diversity; many organisms are very much alike at the most fundamental levels. 
                    \item The differences are subject to particular niches and often highly specialized that allow for biologist to study more complex systems.
                    \item The similarities allow us overcome technical limitations via animals that are easier to study.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item Physiology subdisciplines: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mechanistic: emphasizes the mechanisms by which organisms perform their life functions.
            \item Evolutionary: emphasizes evolutionary origins and the adaptive significance of traits.
            \item Comparative: emphasizes the way in which diverse phylogenetic groups resemble and differ from each other.
            \item Environmental: emphasizes the ways in which physiology and ecology interact.
            \item Integrative: emphasizes the importance of all levels of organization, from genes to proteins and tissues to organs in order to better understand whole physiological systems.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Homeostasis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Important ideas to remember:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Organisms are structurally dynamic; form stays relatively static while individual cells recycle frequently.
            \item Most cells are exposed to the {\color{o-Sun}internal} environment, not external.
            \item Internal cells may vary or kept constant with the environment.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Temperature regulation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Conformity}: organism's internal temperature {\color{o-Sun}correlates} with external temperature in a particular range of temperatures. 
            \item \textbf{Regulation}: internal environment is held mostly {\color{o-Sun}constant} using celluar mechanisms.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homeostasis}: the coordinated physiological processes that maintain a relatively constant state in the organism.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\color{pos}Positive feedback}: less common in homeostasis due difficulty in regulation; leads to runaway effect easily.
            \item {\color{neg}Negative feedback}: more common in homeostasis due to self correcting nature.
            \item \textbf{Effector}: executes the change in action that produces an effect, e.g. signals to increase temperature.
            \item \textbf{Sensor}: sense changes in environment and sends information to the effector.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physiology and Time}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timeframes of physiological change:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Acute}: short-term, reversible, and quick to adapt to changes in environment. Usually minutes to hours.
            \item \textbf{Chronic}: long-term after prolonged exposure to new environments. Changes are usually reversible, but often slower. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Chronic can be termed acclimation, or phenotypic plasticity/flexibility.
                     \item Repetitive acute responses usually lead to chronic responses.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Evolutionary}: changes due to alteration in gene frequencies in {\color{o-Sun}populations} exposed to new environments.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Acclimation is {\color{false}not the same} as adaption.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Adaption} is an evolutionary trait presnet at high frequency in a population due to survival/reproductive advantages. 
            \item Not all traits are adaptations.
            \item The amount of natural variation in a trait must be considered across populations, species etc.
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{Cell Membrane Review}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Major cell memberane structures:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Glycoproteins}: carbohydrate chain attached to a protein.
            \item \textbf{Glycolipids}: similar to glycoproteins, but attached to lipid molecues.
            \item \textit{Glycocalyx}: combination of glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of cell.
            \item \textbf{Integral proteins}: embedded in phospholipid bilayer.
            \item \textbf{Peripheral proteins}: associated with one side of the bilayer.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unsaturated phospholipid}: whey hydrocarbon tails contain double bonds (less hydrogen).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Increase membrane fluidity due to extra space created.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The fluidity of the cell membrane allows proteins to from complexes and dynamically change shape.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Enzyme Fundamentals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enzymes}: a protein catalyst that plays two primary roles: {\color{o-Sun}accelerating} and {\color{o-Sun}regulating} chemical reactions. 
    \item \textit{Substrates}: the initial reactants of the reaction that an enzyme catalyzes.
    \item \textbf{Enzyme-substrate-complex (E-S)}: a combination of enzyme (E) with a molecule of substrate (S) that starts a reaction.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Usually stabalized by {\color{o-Sun}non-covalent} bonds.
            \item The substrate is converted to a product by first becomeing an \textit{enzyme-product complex (E-P)}, then dissociates to yield free product and free enzyme.
            \item {\color{o-Sun}\(E+S\rightleftharpoons \text{E-S} \rightleftharpoons \text{E-P} \rightleftharpoons E + P\)}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Saturation kinetics}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{V\(_{\text{max}}\)}: the maximum velocity of a reaction and is determined by:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The {\color{o-Sun}number} of active enzyme molecues present relative to substrate.
                    \item The catalytic {\color{o-Sun}effectiveness} of each enzyme molecule.
                    \item These properties usually undergo heavy selection pressure.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textit{Saturated}: all enzymes are occupied by a substrate molecule nearly all the time and now unable to increase reaction velocity.
            \item \textbf{Hyperbolic}: asymptotically approaches V\(_{\text{max}}\)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Tends to happen when enzymes have just one substrate binding site.
                    \item Or when substrate sites behave independently
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sigmodal}: approaches V\(_{\text{max}}\) with a sigmodal trajectory.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item When multiple sites influence each other.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Turnover number (k\(_{\text{cat}}\))}: the {\color{o-Sun}total effectiveness}, expressed as the number of substrate molecules coverted to product per second by each enzyme molecule when saturated.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Depends partly on the \textit{activation energy} of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
                    \item \textbf{Activation energy}: the energy required for the substrate to enter the \textit{transition state}. 
                    \item \textbf{Transition state}: the intermediate chemical state between substrate and product.
                    \item Enzymes {\color{o-Sun}lower the activation energy} required to enter transition state.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enzyme-substrate affinity}: The proclivity of the enzyme to form a complex with the substrate when they meet.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\color{pos}Likely} complex formation results in {\color{pos}high-affinity}.
            \item {\color{neg}Unlikely} complex formation results in {\color{neg}low-affinity}.
            \item Affinity affects the shape of the reaction velocity.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item {\color{pos}Higher} affinity produces a {\color{pos}steeper} velocity, and a {\color{neg}lower} affinity produces a more {\color{neg}linear} result.
                    \item Enzyme concentration is not changed.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Half-saturation constant, \(\mathbf{K_m}\)}: the substrate concentration required to attain one-half maximum reaction velocity.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \(K_m\) and enzyme-substrate affinity are  {\color{o-Sun}inversely related}.
                    \item i.e. {\color{neg}low-affinity} enzyme has a {\color{pos}greater \(K_{m}\)}.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Molecular Flexibility}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Conformation}: the three-dimensional shape of a protein.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Stabalized mostly by {\color{o-Sun}weak, noncovalent bonds}---hydrogen, van der Waals, hydrophobic, electrostatic, etc.
                    \item Weak interactions allow for easy yet stable conformational changes.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Enzyme molecules composed of two, three or our proteins are called \textit{dimeric, trimeric}, or \textit{tetrameric} respectively.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Enzymes catalyze reversible reactions in both directions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is because they accelrate the approach towards equilibrium (principles of mass action).
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ligand}: any molecule that selectively binds by noncovalent bonds to structurally and complementary sites on a specific protein.
    \item \textbf{Cooperativity}: the interactions between multiple binding sites that may facilitate or inhibit the binding of other sites.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can either {\color{pos}positive} or {\color{neg}negative}; {\color{pos}facilitating} or {\color{neg}inhibiting} binding on the same molecule.
            \item \textit{{\color{o-Sun}Homotropic} cooperativity}: facilitation or inhibition of the {\color{o-Sun}same ligand}.
            \item \textit{{\color{o-Sun}Heterotropic} cooperativity}: influences on the binding of {\color{o-Sun}other ligands}.
            \item Interactions occur {\color{o-Sun}at a distance}, resulting in delayed, or rippling responses.
            \item \textbf{Allosteric modulation}: the modulation of the {\color{o-Sun}catalytic properties}.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Allosteric sites}: nonsubstrate-binding regulatory sites for {\color {o-Sun}nonsubstrate ligands} that modulate the catalytic properties.
                    \item \textit{Allosteric modulators}: the nonsubstrate ligands.
                    \item Allosteric {\color{pos}\textbf{activation}:increases} and {\color{neg}\textbf{inhibition}:impairs} affinity, thus the {\color{o-Sun}catalytic activity}. 
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Isozymes}: enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction but differ in amino acid sequence.
    \item \textbf{Interspecific enzyme homologs}: different molecular forms of an enzyme coded by homologous gen loci in different species.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Isozymes and interspecific enzyme homologs often {\color{o-Sun}differ} in their {\color{o-Sun}catalytic} and {\color{o-Sun}regulatory} properties.
            \item Functional differences often prove to be adaptive in different environments.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
