## Hello!

Initially made this to get a basic understanding of how to use git and a means for integrating latex into vscode using the fantstic latex workshop extension: https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop

Much of my previous school work, mostly just calculus and physics, was done on overleaf and is not included in this repository. Most university classes and various online notes will be located here going forward. Much of my old work, even in vscode, is depreciated. 

### Disclamers
Starting September 2020 I am attempting to make my notes useable for others than myself. I will attempt give more detailed information even if I think it's not worth noting down or expalining fully. There is a developing structure to the notes that I will soon provide some brief introduction too, and update to any ambiguous formatting/notation choices. 

There is a mediocre spell check (meant for coding, not notes) and no grammar check. In a way, I like this as if forces good typing habits. But I can easily miss typos. 

Also, some information could straight up be wrong &mdash; I'm learning too after all. Organization isn't always the best either; I'm often creating notes from a mixture of live lectures, textbooks, wikipedia, and youtube videos.

# Current Portland State University Class Resources

These notes are a work in progress and I update often. They can be downladed (easier to navigate) but will mostly likely be changed one to two days later.

* [Organic Chemistry Notes](organic-chemistry/org-chem.pdf) | [Apres Lectures Mini Quizzes](organic-chemistry/apres-lecture-quiz.pdf)
* [Organismal Physiology Notes](organismal-physiology/org-phys.pdf)| [Lecture Concepts](organismal-physiology/lecture-concepts.pdf)
* [Evolution Notes](evolution/evolution.pdf) | [Discussion Questions](evolution/discussion-questions.pdf)

Discord links for classes: 
* [CH 334: Organic Chem](https://discord.gg/aVKvN48)
* [BI 358: Evolution](https://discord.gg/Zk8GYGB)
* [BI 320: Organismal Physiology](https://discord.gg/m5dYgGf)


# Online Self Taught Notes

Probably little use to anyone, but including just incase. Also a WIP. 

* [Statistics](statistics/statistics.pdf)
* [Linear Algebra](linear-algebra/linear-algebra.pdf)
* [Python: Pandas](pandas/exercises)


### Want to Help?

If you would like to take notes with me, please do. I have yet to collaborate with anyone on github yet and don't know much about pull requests/merging. I would love to push on this boundary. I could try to make video on setting up vscode with latex, and and intro how to use my latex templates... but I'm a bit pressed for time right now. If anyone really wants some help, then create an issue and I'll do my best.
