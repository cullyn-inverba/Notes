\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is physiology?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Form and function of organisms; the study of how organisms work.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Central questions of physiology: {\color{o-Sun}mechanism} and {\color{o-Sun}origin}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mechanism:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item refers to the {\color{o-Sun}components} of living organisms and understanding {\color{o-Sun}how} components interact to enable the organism to function.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Origin:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item asks why a mechanism exists, or {\color{o-Sun}what} is the mechanistic {\color{o-Sun}adaptive significance} of the mechanism.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Mechanism and adaptive significance are distinct concepts; knowing about one doesn't necessarily mean you know anything about the other.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Krogh's principle: \begin{quote}
        "For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied."\end{quote}
    \item Krogh's principle central to disciplines that rely on the \textit{comparative method}. The key take away: there is unity in diversity; many organisms are very much alike at the most fundamental levels. 
    \item Physiology subdisciplines: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mechanistic: emphasizes the mechanisms by which organisms perform their life functions.
            \item Evolutionary: emphasizes evolutionary origins and the adaptive significance of traits.
            \item Comparative: emphasizes the way in which diverse phylogenetic groups resemble and differ from each other.
            \item Environmental: emphasizes the ways in which physiology and ecology interact.
            \item Integrative: emphasizes the importance of all levels of organization, from genes to proteins and tissues to organs in order to better understand whole physiological systems.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Homeostasis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Important ideas to remember:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Organisms are structurally dynamic; form stays relatively static while individual cells recycle frequently.
            \item Most cells are exposed to the {\color{o-Sun}internal} environment, not external.
            \item Internal cells may vary or kept constant with the environment.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Temperature regulation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Conformity}: organism's internal temperature {\color{o-Sun}correlates} with external temperature in a particular range of temperatures. 
            \item \textbf{Regulation}: internal environment is held mostly {\color{o-Sun}contant} using celluar mechanisms.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homeostasis}: the coordinated physiological processes that maintain a relatively constant state in the organism.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\color{pos}Positive feedback}: less common in homeostasis due difficulty in regulation; leads to runaway effect easily.
            \item {\color{neg}Negative feedback}: more common in homeostasis due to self correcting nature.
            \item \textbf{Effector}: executes the change in action that produces an effect, e.g. signals to increase temperature.
            \item \textbf{Sensor}: sense changes in environment and sends information to the effector.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physiology and Time}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timeframes of physiological change:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Acute}: short-term, reversible, and quick to adapt to changes in environment. Usually minutes to hours.
            \item \textbf{Chronic}: long-term after prolonged exposure to new environments. Changes are usually reversible, but often slower. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Chronic can be termed acclimation, or phenotypic plasticity/flexibility.
                     \item Repetitive acute responses usually lead to chronic responses.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Evolutionary}: changes due to alteration in gene frequencies in {\color{o-Sun}populations} exposed to new environments.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Acclimation is {\color{false}not} the same as adaption.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Adaption} is an evolutionary trait presnet at high frequency in a population due to survival/reproductive advantages. 
            \item Not all traits are adaptations.
            \item The amount of natural variation in a trait must be considered across populations, species etc.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cell Membrane Review}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Major cell memberane structures:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Glycoproteins}: carbohydrate chain attached to a protein.
            \item \textbf{Glycolipids}: similar to glycoproteins, but attached to lipid molecues.
            \item \textit{glycocalyx}: combination of glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of cell.
            \item \textbf{Integral proteins}: embedded in phospholipid bilayer.
            \item \textbf{Peripheral proteins}: associated with one side of the bilayer.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unsaturated phospholipid}: whey hydrocarbon tails contain double bonds (less hydrogen).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Increase membrane fluidity due to extra space created.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The fluidity of the cell membrane allows proteins to from complexes and dynamically change shape.
\end{itemize}
