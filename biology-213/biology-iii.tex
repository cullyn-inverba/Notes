    \hyperlink{39.1}{Form, Function, and Adaptation}
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Animal structures and their functions represent adaptations, which are heritable traits that improve survival and reproduction in a certain environment.
            \item Adaptations involve trade-offs, or inescapable compromises between traits.
            \item Acclimatization is a reversible response to the environment that improves physiological function in that environment.
        \end{itemize}
    \hyperlink{39.2}{Tissues, Organs, and Systems}
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Animal cells with a common function are grouped together into
            four general types of tissue: connective tissue, nervous tissue, muscle tissue, and epithelial tissue.
            \item Organs are structures that are composed of two or more tissues that together perform specific tasks.
            \item Organ systems comprise organs that work together in an integrated fashion to perform one or more functions.
    \end{itemize}
    \hyperlink{39.3}{How Does Body Size Affect Animal Physiology?}
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Large animals have smaller surface area/volume ratios than small animals. As animals grow, their volume increases more rapidly than their surface area. 
            \item Large animals have low mass-specific metabolic rates, in keeping with their relatively small surface area for exchanging the oxygen and nutrients required to support metabolism and the wastes and heat produced by metabolism.
            \item The relatively high surface area of small animals means that they lose heat extremely rapidly.
    \end{itemize}
    \hyperlink{39.4}{Homeostasis}
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Homeostasis refers to relatively constant physical and chemical conditions inside the body. 
            \item Homeostasis in a fluctuating environment is usually achieved by regulation. 
            \item Animals have set points, or target values, for various body parameters. When a parameter is not at its set point, negative feedback occurs. Responses to negative feedback return the parameter to the set point and result in homeostasis. 
            \item Most animals have a set point for body temperature. If an individual overheats, it may pant, sweat, or seek a cool environment; if an individual is cold, it may shiver, bask in sunlight, or fluff its fur or feathers.
        \end{itemize}
    \hyperlink{39.5}{Thermoregulation: A Closer Look}
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Animals vary from endothermic to ectothermic and from homeothermic to poikilothermic. 
            \item Endotherms can be active in cold environments but must obtain a lot of energy to fuel their metabolism. Ectotherms do not require as much energy, but their activity depends on environmental temperature. 
            \item Countercurrent heat exchangers have vessels in close contact that carry warm and cool fluids in opposite directions.
    \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Solutes move across membranes via passive transport, facilitated diffusion, or active transport. Water moves across membranes by osmosis. 
            \item In most animals, epithelial cells that selectively transport water and electrolytes are responsible for homeostasis. 
            \item The mechanisms involved in regulating water and electrolyte balance vary widely among animal groups because different habitats present different types of osmotic stress.
            \item The type of nitrogenous waste excreted by an animal is affected by its phylogeny and its habitat type. Most fishes excrete ammonia; mammals and most adult amphibians excrete urea; and insects and reptiles excrete uric acid.
        \end{itemize}
        \hyperlink{40.2}{Water and Electrolyte in Marine Fishes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Seawater is strongly hyperosmotic to the tissues of marine bony fishes, so they tend to lose water by osmosis and gain electrolytes by diffusion. 
            \item Marine bony fishes are osmoregulators, whereas cartilaginous fishes including sharks are osmoconformers. 
            \item Epithelial cells in the shark rectal gland and in the gills of marine bony fishes excrete excess salt using Na\(^+\)/K\(^+\)­ATPase and Na\(^+\)/Cl\(^+\)/K\(^+\) cotransporters located in the basolateral membrane. 
            \item Similar salt­excreting cells also exist in the salt glands of marine birds and other reptiles and in the kidneys of mammals.
        \end{itemize}
        \hyperlink{40.3}{Water and Electrolyte in Freshwater Fishes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Freshwater is strongly hyposmotic to the blood of freshwater fishes, so they tend to gain water by osmosis and lose electrolytes by diffusion. 
            \item Epithelial cells in the gills of freshwater fishes import ions using Na\(^+\)/K\(^+\)­ATPase located in the basolateral membrane and Na\(^+\)/Cl\(^-\)/K\(^+\) cotransporters located in the apical membrane.
        \end{itemize}
        \hyperlink{40.5}{Water and Electrolyte in Vertebrates} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Nephrons in the vertebrate kidney form a filtrate in the renal corpuscle and then reabsorb valuable nutrients, electrolytes, and water in the proximal tubule. 
            \item A solution containing urea and electrolytes flows through the loop of Henle of mammalian kidneys, where changes in the permeability of epithelial cells to water and salt—along with active transport of salt—create a steep osmotic gradient. 
            \item Antidiuretic hormone increases the water permeability of the collecting duct, causing water to be reabsorbed along the osmotic gradient and hyperosmotic urine to be produced. 
            \item The nephrons of fishes, amphibians, and non­avian reptiles do not have loops of Henle and therefore cannot produce urine that is hyperosmotic to the body fluids. However, some of these vertebrates can produce hyperosmotic urine by reabsorbing water from the cloaca or bladder.
        \end{itemize}

    \hyperlink{41.1}{Nutritional Requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The diets of animals include fats, carbohydrates, and proteins that provide energy; vitamins that serve as coenzymes and perform other functions; minerals that are used as components of enzyme cofactors or structural materials; and ions of electrolytes required for osmotic balance and normal membrane function. 
        \item Fats contain more energy (about 9 kcal/g) than carbohydrates or proteins (about 4 kcal/g), making fats an efficient way to store energy in the body.
    \end{itemize}
    \hyperlink{41.3}{How Are Nutrients Digested and Absorbed?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most animals have a digestive tract that begins at the mouth and ends at the anus. 
        \item In many animals, chemical digestion of food begins in the mouth. In mammals, salivary amylase hydrolyzes bonds in starch and glycogen, and lingual lipase hydrolyzes bonds in fats. 
        \item Once food is swallowed, it is propelled down the esophagus by peristalsis. 
        \item Digestion continues in the stomach. In the human stomach, a highly acidic environment denatures proteins, and the enzyme pepsin begins the cleavage of peptide bonds that link amino acids. 
        \item Food passes from the stomach into the small intestine, where it is mixed with secretions from the pancreas and liver. 
        \item In the small intestine, carbohydrate digestion is continued by pancreatic amylase; fats are emulsified by bile salts and digested by pancreatic lipase; and protein digestion is completed by a suite of pancreatic proteases. 
        \item Cells that line the small intestine absorb the nutrients released by digestion. In many cases, uptake is driven by an electrochemical gradient established by Na\(^+\)/K\(^+\)-ATPase that favors the diffusion of Na\(^+\) into the cells. 
        \item As solutes leave the lumen of the small intestine and enter cells, water follows by osmosis. 
        \item Water reabsorption is completed in the large intestine, where feces form. 
        \item The structure of organs in the digestive tract varies widely among species, in ways that support processing of the food each species ingests.
    \end{itemize}
    \hyperlink{41.4}{Nutritional Homeostasis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Diabetes mellitus is a condition in which the level of glucose in the blood is abnormally high.
        \item Type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by a defect in the production of insulin—a hormone secreted by the pancreas that promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood.
        \item Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by a failure of cells to respond to insulin.
        \item The development of type 2 diabetes is correlated with obesity. The incidence of this disease has reached epidemic proportions in many populations.
    \end{itemize}
