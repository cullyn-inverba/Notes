Hello and welcome. This repository is an attempt at increasing the effectiveness of online learning, for myself and others. The main function of this repository will be a place to store and share notes I make&mdash;hopefully doing so will encourage others to do the same!

## Using Git

It's not necessary to use git to get the most out of this repository, most of it can be viewed on GitHub. However, I will be adding slides provided by instructors, other class dependent resources, and constant updates to notes as term progresses. Rather than download them all through d2l, or each thing one link at a time, you can instead just capitalize on the time I will take doing it for myself anyways. 

**Steps to update your local files with this repository**

1. Make sure you have [**git** installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  
2. Open a terminal.  
3. Download this repository onto your machine:

    ```
    git clone ghttps://github.com/cullyn-inverba/notes.git
    ```
4. That's it. You now have a folder called &ldquo;notes&rdquo; which is a copy of the one I pushed to GitHub. You now have all resources I have included in this repository. 

**Updating Files**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change your directory (cd) to where you cloned the repository:

    ```
    cd notes
    ```
    or

    ```
    cd ~/path/to/folder
    ```
3. Update the folder if there is something I added recently. This will update your folder to match what is currently on GitHub. 
    ```
    git pull
    ```
4. You're all set. There are probably other ways of doing this, but this is the most basic way to do it.

### Disclaimers

- Some information could up be wrong&mdash;I'm learning too after all. Please don't be afraid to point out errors! It's part of the reason I'm making this public.

- Most of old files are compressed and here just in case I need them, but once most of previously mentioned goals are complete, then most of my depreciated notes files will be gone. Only notes that I deem to be good enough will remain in the future.
