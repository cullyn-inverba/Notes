\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is physiology?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Form and function of organisms; the study of how organisms work.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Central questions of physiology: {\color{o-Sun}mechanism} and {\color{o-Sun}origin}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mechanism:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item refers to the {\color{o-Sun}components} of living organisms and understanding {\color{o-Sun}how} components interact to enable the organism to function.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Origin:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item asks why a mechanism exists, or {\color{o-Sun}what} is the mechanistic {\color{o-Sun}adaptive significance} of the mechanism.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Mechanism and adaptive significance are distinct concepts; knowing about one doesn't necessarily mean you know anything about the other.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Krogh's principle: \begin{quote}
        "For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied."\end{quote}
    \item Krogh's principle central to disciplines that rely on the \textit{comparative method}. The key take away: there is unity in diversity; many organisms are very much alike at the most fundamental levels. 
    \item Physiology subdisciplines: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mechanistic: emphasizes the mechanisms by which organisms perform their life functions.
            \item Evolutionary: emphasizes evolutionary origins and the adaptive significance of traits.
            \item Comparative: emphasizes the way in which diverse phylogenetic groups resemble and differ from each other.
            \item Environmental: emphasizes the ways in which physiology and ecology interact.
            \item Integrative: emphasizes the importance of all levels of organization, from genes to proteins and tissues to organs in order to better understand whole physiological systems.
        \end{itemize}
