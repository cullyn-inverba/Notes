Initially made this to get a basic understanding of how to use git and integrate latex into vscode. 

There is no real reason for me to continue to push my notes here, but it's usefull to come back to tex code for future projects. There's probably a better way to do so admittedly, but I'm addicted to seeing commit logs as sign of progress tracking. 

Much of my previous school work was done on overleaf where I did calculus and physics homework, but I am only including future work from now on.
